# Event Driven .NET

An event-driven microservices platform for .NET

## Introduction

The purpose of **Event Driven .NET** is to provide a platform where .NET developers can build loosely coupled distributed systems consisting of services that can be versioned, deployed and scaled independently. It supplies **abstractions and libraries** for implementing [Domain Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) (DDD), [Command Query Responsibility Segregation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/cqrs) (CQRS) and [Event Driven Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture) (EDA). It also includes a [Reference Architecture](https://github.com/event-driven-dotnet/EventDriven.ReferenceArchitecture) which serves as an **example** for how you can build event-driven microservices that communicate with one another asynchronously over an [Event Bus Abstraction](https://github.com/event-driven-dotnet/EventDriven.EventBus.Abstractions).
